## Future Academic Projects

### Reconics: *Modular Mechatronic System for Precision Liquid Handling*
**Description:** Interdisciplinary academic engineering project (Reconics Phase A) developing a modular mechatronic system with embedded control software for precision liquid handling applications. The project focuses on designing and prototyping a single-channel electronic pipette to validate the proposed architecture, precision control approach, and modular design principles. This collaborative project combines Informatics (embedded systems, software architecture, control algorithms) and Industrial Engineering (mechanical design, mechatronic systems integration, prototyping) expertise.

**Key Features:**
- Target volumetric resolution of 0.5 μL with sub-micrometer positioning accuracy
- Modular software architecture with hardware abstraction layers
- Closed-loop position control using encoder feedback and calibration algorithms
- Compact stepper motor with planetary gearbox and fine-pitch lead screw
- Mathematical validation through kinematic analysis and force budget calculations

**Technologies:** Embedded C/C++, Real-time control systems, CAD (mechanical design), Stepper motor control, Encoder-based closed-loop control

**Status:** Planning phase
