## Mathijs Follon
*Informatics Student -- UHasselt -- Embedded Software Enthusiast*

Welcome to my academic portfolio! I'm a student in Informatics at Universiteit Hasselt and currently working as an Intern Embedded Software Developer at **imo-imomec**, where I contribute to the OSCAR project with the software team, developing quantum sensor technologies for space applications.


## About

I'm passionate about exploring the frontiers of technology, particularly in **embedded systems**, **software architecture**, and **mechatronic systems**. My academic journey focuses on bridging theory and practice, contributing to both academic research and real-world applications in precision control systems.

Currently, I'm involved in the **OSCAR-PINQ** project, which aims to bring diamond-based quantum sensor technologies to space, building on previous experiences from the OSCAR project series. This work involves developing embedded programming solutions for miniaturized diamond-based magnetometers with pulse measurement techniques for Earth observation applications.

## Current Focus

- **Embedded Systems Development**: Working with embedded C/C++ for precision control applications
- **Quantum Sensor Technologies**: Contributing to space-bound quantum sensor systems
- **Mechatronic Systems**: Designing modular systems for precision liquid handling (Reconics project - Phase A)
